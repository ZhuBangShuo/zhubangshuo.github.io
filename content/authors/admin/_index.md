    summary: |2-
      At the beginning of 2024, I fully transitioned to the role of Product Development & Technical Support Lead at Lessn. In this capacity, I ensured that the direction of product development aligned with business objectives. I wrote product briefs, set priorities for the development team, and created financial reports to identify key insights on usage and revenue.

      As Lessn was a start-up, all of us wore many hats; I was also in charge of pre-deployment testing, product health monitoring, and customer relationship management.

      As the primary pre-deployment tester, I was in charge of ensuring that every build deployed to the user acceptance testing environment met requirements and was bug-free before it was deployed to production. I was also in charge of updating the acceptance test criteria as new features were added or extant features were modified.

      As the primary monitor of platform health, in the case of an alarm I was in charge of triaging the issue, investigating, creating, and ideating a fix - in cooperation with the development team - and testing the fix before it was deployed. I was the first to respond to alarms and the first point of contact for customers experiencing issues.

      Along with being the first point of customer support contact, I also had responsibilities in customer relationship management. In cases where user experience was negatively impacted, I was in charge of notifying customers through Hubspot and providing technical support where necessary.

      This varied set of responsibilities came together to form a uniquely rewarding role that required technical knowledge, deep familiarity with both the business aspects of the product as well as the technical aspects of the codebase, and strength in face-to-face communication and professional writing.

      First in-house developer at Lessn.

      I worked on the full stack, building the platform frontend on Vue.js using the Ant Design framework, with some work encompassing residual code written with blade templates on php. Backend work entailed working with proprietary Promis code to create and manage API controllers and Mongo queries. AWS lambdas and state machines were integrated in the infrastructure.
